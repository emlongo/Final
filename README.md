Title: PM 566 Final Project: Prospective Randomized Trial on Chronic Disease Patient Education Videos at an Urban Safety Net Hospital

Brief Description: A prospective interventional study was conducted at LAC+USC Medical Center to evaluate the effect of a mobile educational tool delivered to hospitalized patients with CHF on patient experience, health literacy, and clinical outcomes. The hypothesis is that patients who complete the mobile educational experience will have higher quiz scores and satisfaction scores compared to patients who do not. The data was wrangled, explored, and analyzed in RStudio. Overall, the mobile educational experience was associated with increasing patients' knowledge about their chronic disease (as measured by quiz scores), but not associated with improving patients' hospital experience (as measured by satisfaction scores).
